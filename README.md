# PAC-MAN PROJECTs

[Link](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html)

-Studied and implemented various algorithms using Python to simulate conceptual knowledge for the subject.
-Algorithms included DFS, BFS, uniform cost, A* search, minimax and expectimax
-Implemented model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms
-Studied and implemented the perceptron algorithm and gradient descent, which was used to train neural network classifiers.
-Also, got a thorough knowledge about Bayes Networks.
