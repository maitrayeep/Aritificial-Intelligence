# PAC-MAN PROJECTs

Worked on projects for an introductory class on **Artificial Intelligence** ([Berkeley Pac-man project](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html))

**Take Aways**
- Studied and implemented various algorithms using Python to simulate conceptual knowledge for the subject.
- Algorithms included DFS, BFS, uniform cost, A* search, minimax and expectimax
- Implemented model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms
- Studied and implemented the perceptron algorithm and gradient descent, which was used to train neural network classifiers.
- Also, got a thorough knowledge about Bayes Networks.
